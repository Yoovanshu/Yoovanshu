- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yoovanshu . I'm a Physics Major at Panjab University, Chandigarh.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, hardware, mechanics, robotics and maybe a little bit of boxing & badminton.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code primarily in Python from a Udemy bootcamp alongside of Harvard's cs50 course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-sorce projects or even some smaller, lregular projects since I'm a beginner as of now.
